\chapter{Background}

The following chapter provides a quick introduction to the theoretical foundation of this work. The extraction of \textit{Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes} from \textit{Simulink} model requires an understanding of \textit{dynamic systems}, \textit{stochastic processes}, specifically \textit{Markov Chains}, \textit{Markov Decision Processes} and \textit{Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes}, and finally \textit{Simulink}. This chapter introduces each of these concepts or tools, providing examples where helpful. An understanding of these key concepts will facilitate the understanding of the next two chapters, \textit{Methodology} and \textit{Implementation}.
