\chapter{Implementation}
\label{implementation}

The following chapter describes the implementation of both the \textit{extractor} and the \textit{validator}, building upon the methodology introduced in chapter~\ref{methodology}. Because of the limited scope of this text and detailed comments in the source code and the configuration files, the following sections will only provide a high-level overview of the implementation, going into more detailed discussion only for a number of rather interesting aspects.
