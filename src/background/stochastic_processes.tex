\section{Stochastic Processes}

Stochastic processes describe systems that change probabilistically. Unlike deterministic processes, where the same initial conditions and excitation will always lead to the same result, stochastic processes develop randomly. This means that two dynamic systems that start at the same state and are given the exact same inputs may differ in their output.

Stochastic processes are useful in two cases. Firstly to model systems that are physically random (quantum physics) and secondly to model abstractions of reality. The latter case occurs when we choose to model a system probabilistically because we either don't understand the underlying dynamics or because we choose to model them probabilistically instead of deterministically.

The next three sections build upon each other, starting with Markov Chains, then extending these to Markov Decision Processes and finally to Partially Observable Markov Chains.
