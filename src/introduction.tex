\chapter{Introduction}

This bachelor thesis was completed at the Institute of Machine Tools and Manufacturing of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology. The goal of this work was the study of the feasability of and the development of an extraction tool that can transform a dynamic probabilistic non-linear Simulink model into a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process. The Institute of Machine Tools and Manufacturing's Innovation Center Virtual Reality has developed a number of POMDP-driven controllers, solving problems such as the parallax effect caused by the thickness of touch-screen displays.

This thesis occured as part of a large research project financed by the Swiss Commission for Technology and Innovation and ABB Switzerland. Project partners also include two Waste-to-Energy pilot plants and two smaller Swiss universities. The goal of the project is the development of a Waste-to-Energy plant-manager assistant using POMDP-control (similar research has already shown promise \cite{ballesterostowards}). In order to develop a POMDP-based controller, the existing Simulink models must be converted to POMDPs, which is exactly the goal of this thesis.

During the course of this research a prototype extraction algorithm was developed as well as a validation tool, required to assess the quality of the transformed dynamic system description. This thesis presents the theoretical foundation of this work in chapter~\ref{background}. The methodology behind the developed extraction tool and the validation tool is then introduced in chapter~\ref{methodology}. Concrete implementation details for both the extractor and the validator are provided in chapter~\ref{implementation}. An evaluation of the extraction algorithm is presented in chapter~\ref{results} and a discussion thereof in chapter~\ref{discussion}. Finally a conclusion and an outlook are given in chapter~\ref{conclusionoutlook}.
