\chapter{Introduction}

This bachelor thesis was completed at the Institute of Machine Tools and Manufacturing of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology. The motivation of this work was the development of a an extraction tool that can transform a dynamic probabilistic non-linear Simulink model into a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process.

During the course of this research a prototype extraction algorithm was developed as well as a validation tool, required to assess the quality of the transformed dynamic system description.

This thesis presents the theoretical foundation of this work in chapter~\ref{background}. The methodology behind the developed extraction tool and the validation tool is then introduced in chapter~\ref{methodology}. Concrete implementation details for both the extractor and the validator are described in chapter~\ref{implementation} and finally the results of this work are discussed in chapter~\ref{results}, by studying the result of an extraction using the developed validation tool.
